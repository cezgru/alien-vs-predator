# Alien vs Predator

This is an implementation of a neural network utilising transfer learing used for small image classification.

The data used for teaching our model is compiled and made available on the kaggle website under the following link:

The intent of this project is purely educational, focusing specifically on implementation differences between Keras and PyTorch.
As such, this model offers very little real use to anyone, and is simply the blueprint of a baseline transfer learning model.
